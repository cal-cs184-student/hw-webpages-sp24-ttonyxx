      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <p>
        Throughout this homework we built a rasterizer that renders vector
        graphics through a variety of ways to improve the end result. The idea
        behind this is that there are vector representations of what we want to
        render and we have to convert those to pixel color values. There are a
        variety of implementations and strategies that go into getting the best
        value to set the pixel to to make sure that it had a good end result.
      </p>

      <p>
        We learned a lot of things through this homework. Before completing this
        assignment, we both had very little experience with computer graphics.
        We used graphics rendering programs, but never had experience creating
        one ourselves. It was really interesting and satisfying to program the
        supersampling and then see all the images look better. The concepts
        behind the different kinds of sampling and using the different mipmap
        levels to get the best sampling rate were very interesting as well.
        Being able to render textures over images using pure math and
        computation and to get it all to look even better with the
        aforementioned techniques made this a really satisfying assignemnt to
        complete.
      </p>

      <h2>Task 1</h2>

      <p>
        The way we rasterized the triangle was by first calculating the bounding
        box of the triangle to see which coordinates we need to check. We then
        iterated through all those coordinates and converted them to barycentric
        coordinates to check if it was in the triangle (all > 0). If it was then
        we colored the pixel with the color given to us.
      </p>

      <p>
        The algorithm is no worse than the one that checks every single sample
        in the bounding box because in our algorithm we do exactly that. We go
        through every sample in the bounding box and see calculate to see if it
        is in the triangle.
      </p>

          style="border: 1px black solid; border-radius: 10px"
        />
      </div>

      <h2>Task 2</h2>

      <p>
        The basic idea behind our supersampling is that we put everything that
        we want to draw on the frame buffer onto the sample buffer first. This
        is because the sample buffer will always be width * height * sample_rate
        since with supersampling we need sample_rate times more data per pixel
        of the frame buffer. To accomplish this, we needed to change the size of
        the sample buffer anywhere the frame buffer size was changed or the
        sample rate was changed. And, at the end when we resolve to frame
        buffer, we will average the sample_rate number of pixels in the sample
        buffer that correspond to the single pixel in the frame buffer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Supersampling is useful because it improves the quality of the image
        through providing benefits such as anti-aliasing and reducing Moir√©
        Patterns. It antialiases the triangles because we rasterize the triangle
        to a higher resolution and then average a sample_rate number of pixels
        to represent one pixel in the frame buffer, thus anti-alisasing the
        triangle since it reduces the high frequency around the edges.
      </p>

      <div class="space-between-items">
        <img
          src="assets/sample1.png"
          width="30%"
          style="border: 1px black solid; border-radius: 10px"
        />

        <img
          src="assets/sample4.png"
          width="30%"

        />

        <img
          src="assets/sample16.png"
          width="30%"
          style="border: 1px black solid; border-radius: 10px"
        />
      </div>

      <p>
        In the images above, you can see the left corner of the red triangle at
        1, 4, and 16 sampling rates. The reason why we observe these differences
        is because we are using higher and higher resolutions. The higher the
        sample rate, the more samples we get per pixel and thus we can see more
        pixels that are in between red and white since it is averaging more of a
        range of number of red vs white pixels in higher resolutions.
      </p>

      <h2>Task 3</h2>

      <div class="center-items">
        <img
          src="assets/robot.png"
          width="50%"
          style="border: 1px black solid; border-radius: 10px"
        />
      </div>

      <p>
        We rotated the rectangles in the arm of the robot to make it look like
        it's waving. We also changed the color to cyan!
      </p>

      <h2>Task 4</h2>

      <p>
        Barycentric coordinates are coordinates that are used to express the
        position of a point inside a triangle using three coordinates that add
        up to 1. Each of these coordinates corresponds to a vertex of the
        triangle. The higher the coordinate is the closer it is to the vertex it
        corresponds to.
      </p>

      <div class="center-items">
        <img
          src="assets/triangle.png"
          width="50%"
          style="border: 1px black solid; border-radius: 10px"
        />
      </div>

      <p>
        In the image above, we are doing a linear interpolation using
        barycentric coordinates. As you can see, each vertex has a different
        color associated with it. If we multiply the barycentric coordinates by
        the color of each vertex, we get the color of the pixel and the closer
        it is to a vertex the more like that color it is.
      </p>

      <h2>Task 5</h2>

      <p>
        Pixel sampling is the process of determining the color of a pixel by
        examing pixels around it. In our specific case, we implemented two pixel
        sampling methods - nearest and bilinear. The nearest pixel sampling
        method is where you take the nearest pixel on the texture and then use
        that color. The bilinear sampling method is where you take the four
        neareset points and then do linear interpolation on the colors.
      </p>

      <p>
        We implemented these sampling techniques when we rasterized a textured
        triangle by going through each coordinate of the triangle and finding
        it's barycentric coordinates. We use those to find the corresponding
        location on the textured triangle and then we use one of the two
        sampling methods to find the color of the pixel. We created a function
        lerp that we use for bilinear interpolation where it interpolates the
        color based on the four nearest squares. For the nearest pixel sampling
        method, we just round to the nearest pixel of the texture and set the
        pixel to that color.

          />
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        We can see that the bilinear sampling is much better than nearest for
        sampling rate of 1 since it provides some anti-aliasing benefit by doing
        a linear interpolation over the 4 nearest pixels. We can see that when
        we increase the sampling rate to 16, both have less artifacts and the
        difference between bilinear and nearest is less noticable.
      </p>

      <h2>Task 6</h2>

      <p>
        Level sampling is where we choose from precomputed downsampled versions
        of the texture to sample from based on the viewing distance or angle. We
        implemented it for texture mapping using a mipmap, which stored
        downsampled versions of the original texture.
      </p>

      <p>
        The problem is that if the triangle on texture space that we are mapping
        over is much larger than the triangle on your screen space, then it is
        very likely that the triangle in screen space will sample random pixels
        that may have pixel values that don't really represent the entire
        triangle in texture space. So, to find the exact level D of the mipmap
        that we want to use, we just need to base it on this difference between
        screen space and texture space. If the sample pixels are much farther
        away on texture space than screen space, then we have to downsample the
        texture a lot, blurring it so that it doesn't have random artifacts.
      </p>

      <p>
        To accomplish this, we calculated the max of the norm of (du/dx, dv/dx)
        and (du/dy, dv/dy). The larger these norms are, the larger their change
        of rate is in the texture space with respect to the screen space. We
        then take the log base 2 of the max and then we get the level, selecting
        the right texture from the mipmap and then sampling from it.
      </p>

      <p>
        For lsm == L_NEAREST, we just rounded the resulting D level to the
        nearest valid mipmap level and passed it as a parameter to the nearest
        or bilinear sample function. For lsm == L_LINEAR, we computed a linear
        interpolation of the pixel results given by the two nearest levels.
      </p>

      <h3>Tradeoffs between different sampling techniques</h3>

      <h4>Pixel Sampling</h4>

      <p>
        Faster because it only involes sampling at the pixel level. Doesn't use
        much memory because it just samples from nearby pixels. But,
        antialiasing power isn't that great and may leave some artifacts with
        high-frequency details.
      </p>

      <h4>Level Sampling</h4>

      <p>
        It can reduce speed since all the levels are precomputed and reduces the
        number of texture samples as well. It requires additional memory since
        we need to store the precomputed mipmaps. And, it reduces aliasing
        artifacts significantly and is especially effective when there are
        varying distances and viewing angles.
      </p>

      <h4>Number of Samples Per Pixel</h4>

      <p>
        It's slower if there are more samples since it takes more time to run
        the calculations. It requires more memory to store more samples since we
        are increasing the resolution. It's very effective since it captures
        more information per pixel, especially with smoothing edges.

      <h2>Challenges</h2>

      <p>
        This being our first experience working with graphics, it wasn't all
        sunshine and rainbows. Some of the techniques (i.e. level sampling and
        bilinear sampling) had a lot of mathmatical reasoning that we had to
        figure out before we could start building the logic for this assignment.
        At first, barycentric coordinates weren't the most intuitive, but after
        we delved into the math and were able to derive where the equation came
        from, we were able to get it right. We also had some initial trouble
        figuring out the right way to approach the sample rate implementation
        since we weren't sure what the best way to go about the implementation
        was. But, then reading into the assignment and the hints, it gave us the
        notion that the best way to do it was with the sample_buffer resolution
        adjusting. Overall, it was a very fun assignment and we learned a lot through the process :)!
